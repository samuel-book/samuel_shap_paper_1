We generally handle SHAP values as how they affect log odds of receiving thrombolysis, but for individual predictions, probability plots are more intuitive.

The model starts with a base prediction of a 24% probability of receiving thrombolysis, before feature values are taken into account. For the patient with a low probability of receiving thrombolysis, the two most influential features reducing the probability of receiving thrombolysis are a long arrival-to-scan time (138 minutes) and a low stroke severity (NIHSS=2). For the patient with a high probability of receiving thrombolysis, the two most influential features increading the probability of receiving thrombolysis are a short arrival-to-scan time (17 minutes) and a moderate stroke severity (NIHSS=14). \n",

When we examined the hospital SHAP values only for patients attending each hospital, the hospital SHAP values ranged from -1.4 to +1.4.
