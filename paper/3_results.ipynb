    "When examining SHAP, we take the hospital SHAP values for patients attending each hospital (if we examined the hospital SHAP for all patients, it would be dominated by those not-attending each hospital (i.e. coded zero in the one-hot encoding). When we examine the hospital SHAP values only for patients attending each hospital, the hospital SHAP values ranged from -1.4 to +1.4. This range of SHAP (log odds) represents a 15 fold difference in odds of receiving thrombolysis (most are in the range of -1 to +1, but this still represents a 7-8 fold difference in odds of receiving thrombolysis).\n",

    "We compared the hospital SHAP value with the observed thrombolysis use at each hospital. Hospital SHAP correlated with observed thrombolysis rate with an r-squared of 0.582, suggesting that 58% (P<0.0001) of the between-hospital variance in thrombolysis use may be explained by the hospitals' SHAP values, that is the hospitals' predisposition to use thrombolysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Waterfall plots show the influence of features for an individual prediction. We generally handle SHAP values as how they affect log odds of receiving thrombolysis, but for individual predictions, probability plots are more intuitive. The example shown below is for a patient with a low probability of receiving thrombolysis. The model starts with a base prediction of a 24% probability of receiving thrombolysis, before feature values are taken into account. Some features increase that base probability of receiving thrombolysis, those are onet-to-arrival time, having a precise onset time, having no prior disability, and being young. Three features then reduce the probability of receiving thrombolysis: the hospital they attended, the long arrival-to-scan time, and having a mild stroke, with a resulting final probability of receiving thrombolysis of 3%. \n",
