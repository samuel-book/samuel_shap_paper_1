    "## Explaining model predictions with SHAP\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP values describe how much a feature affects the probability of receiving thrombolysis. These are usually expressed as log odds. Below is a brief introduction to probability, odds, log odds and SHAP values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability, odds, and Shap values (log odds shifts): A brief explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us find it easiest to think of the chance of something occurring as a probability. For example, there might be a probability of 10% that it will rain today. That is the same as saying there will be one rainy day out of ten days for days with this given probability of rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our stroke thrombolysis model, Shap values tell us how knowing something particular about a patient (such as the patient *feature*, 'Is their stroke caused by a clot or a bleed?') adjusts our prediction of whether they will receive thrombolysis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is made a little more complicated for us because Shap is usually reported as a *log odds shift*. It is useful for us to see how those relate to probabilities, and get a sense of how significant Shap values in the range of 0.5 to 5 (or -0.5 to -5) are, as that is a common range of Shap values that we will see in our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the example that Shap reports that a model's base probability prediction, before the contribution of features is 0.25, or a 25% probability of receiving thrombolysis; that is 1 in 4 patients with this prediction would be expected to receive thrombolysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "*Probability* expresses the chance of something happening as the number of positive occurrences as a fraction of all occurrences (i.e. the number of patients receiving thrombolysis as a fraction of the total number of patients).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Odds* express the chance of something happening as the ratio of the number of positive occurrences (i.e. receiving thrombolysis) to the number of negative occurrences (i.e. *not* receiving thrombolysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have probability prediction of 0.25 would receive thrombolysis, that would mean 1 in 4 of those patients receive thrombolysis. Expressed as odds, for every one patient that receives thrombolysis, three will not. The odds are expressed as 1:3 or 1/3. This may also be calculated as a decimal (1 divided by 3), 0.333.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odds (O) and probability (P) may be converted with the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  O = P / (1 - P)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  P = O / (1 + O)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shap values: Log odds shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will calculate the effect of Shap values, and try and build some intuition on the size of effect Shap values of 0.5 to 5 give (we will look at positive and negative Shap values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shap usually outputs the effect of a particular feature in how much it shifts the odds. For reasons we will not go into here, that shift (which is the 'Shap value') is usually given in 'log odds' (the logarithm of the odds value). For the mathematically inclined, we use the natural log (*ln*).\n",

    "Waterfall plots show the influence of features for an individual prediction. We generally handle SHAP values as how they affect log odds of receiving thrombolysis, but for individual predictions, probability plots are more intuitive. The example shown below is for a patient with a low probability of receiving thrombolysis. The model starts with a base prediction of a 24% probability of receiving thrombolysis, before feature values are taken into account. Some features increase that base probability of receiving thrombolysis, those are onet-to-arrival time, having a precise onset time, having no prior disability, and being young. Three features then reduce the probability of receiving thrombolysis: the hospital they attended, the long arrival-to-scan time, and having a mild stroke, with a resulting final probability of receiving thrombolysis of 3%. \n",
