    "# Expkloring differences clinical decision making between high and low thrombolysing hospitals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plain English summary\n",
    "\n",
    "It has become apparent that hospitals are making different clinical decisions, and it is not just the patient group that is accounting for the difference in thrombolysis rates between hosptials. Here we create two groups of hospitals: those that have a high propensity to thrombolyse, and those that have a low propensity to thrombolyse. Comparing the SHAP values between these two hospital groups shows that .... Trying to pick apart what factors the diff hospital groups are using to make their different decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "low and high hosptials have same general pattern, but thrshoelds for it are different. Nothing dramatic about who they thrombolyse, just that less likely to thrombolyse across variaous categories. Are the NIHSS going to be pulled apart more in bootom than middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model and data\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost models were trained on stratified k-fold cross-validation data. The 8 features in the model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arrival-to-scan time: Time from arrival at hospital to scan (mins)\n",
    "* Infarction: Stroke type (1 = infarction, 0 = haemorrhage)\n",
    "* Stroke severity: Stroke severity (NIHSS) on arrival\n",
    "* Precise onset time: Onset time type (1 = precise, 0 = best estimate)\n",
    "* Prior disability level: Disability level (modified Rankin Scale) before stroke\n",
    "* Stroke team: Stroke team attended\n",
    "* Use of AF anticoagulents: Use of atrial fibrillation anticoagulant (1 = Yes, 0 = No)\n",
    "* Onset-to-arrival time: Time from onset of stroke to arrival at hospital (mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "And one target feature:\n",
    "* Thrombolysis: Recieve thrombolysis (1 = Yes, 0 = No)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8 features included in the model (to predict whether a patient will recieve thrombolysis) were chosen sequentially as having the single best improvement in model performance (using the ROC AUC). The stroke team feature is included as a one-hot encoded feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library SHAP was applied to the first k-fold model to obtain a SHAP value for each feature, for each instance. SHAP values are in the same units as the model output, so for XGBoost this is in log odds-ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single SHAP value per feature was obtained by taking the mean of the absolute values across all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aims:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify top 30 and bottom 30 hosptials judged by the 10k cohort dataset\n",
    "* Fit XGBoost model to each of the 5 k-fold train/test splits.\n",
    "* Get SHAP values for the first k-fold split.\n",
    "* Plot SHAP values for two features (NIHSS and mRS) for the top 30 and bottom 30 hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "* There was good consiency of SHAP values and importances across 5 k-fold replications.\n",
    "* There was a reasonable correlation between SHAP and feature importance values, but also some differences in the rank order of importance.\n",
    "    The five most influential features as judged by SHAP were:\n",
    "    * Stroke type\n",
    "    * Arrival-to-scan time\n",
    "    * Stroke severity (NIHSS)\n",
    "    * Stroke onset time type (precise vs. estimated)\n",
    "    * Disability level (Rankin) before stroke\n",
    "* The five most influential features (excluding teams) as judged by importance were:\n",
    "    * Stroke type\n",
    "    * Use of AF Anticoagulant\n",
    "    * Stroke onset time type (precise vs. estimated)\n",
    "    * Stroke severity (NIHSS)\n",
    "    * Disability level (Rankin) before stroke\n",
    "* Beeswarm, waterfall, and scatter plots all help elucidate the relationship between feature values and SHAP value.\n",
    "* Plotting SHAP values as probabilities are more understandable than plotting as log odds-ratios, but can distort the relative importance of features overall.\n",
